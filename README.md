# Tasks (Definex Java Spring Boot Bootcamp Final Project)
## Task management application for enterprises of all sizes.

Tasks is an advanced task management system that provides functionalities such as creating tasks, assigning tasks to users and managing teams, projects and more. Tasks resembles various project management tools one of them being Jƒ±ra by Atlassian. The tech stack used for the application consists of Java, Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, Redis and Docker.

## Installation


1. Before running the application make sure you have the following installed:
- Docker
- Docker-Compose
- Maven
- JDK 17 or later

2. Clone the repository with the command:
```ruby
git clone https://github.com/cnbrkaydemir/definex-final.git
```


3. Setup Environmental Variables:

Before running the application, you need to create a .env file and configure the database credentials.
* Create a .env file.

```ruby
touch .env
```
* Create a .env file and set the necessary variables:
```ruby
DB_USER=your_user_name
DB_PASSWORD=your_password
DB_ENTRY=database_name
```

4. Running Redis and PostgreSql with Docker Compose:

Once the .env file is ready, simply run:
```ruby
docker-compose up --build
```
To stop and remove the containers, run:

```ruby
docker-compose down
```

5. After the docker container is up and running run the application with the Maven command:
```ruby
mvn spring-boot:run
```

## Features

### Team Member Assignment

- Implemented user roles (Project Manager, Team Leader, Team Member)
- Created functionality for assigning team members to projects and tasks

### Progress Tracking

- Implemented the validation system for task progression required for an advanced task management system.

### File Storage for Attachments

- Built file upload and attachment system for tasks
- Implemented secure file storage on disk
- Created database entities for tracking uploaded files

### Comment Functionality
- Implemented business logic based on comments, enabling team members to assign comments to tasks.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Spring Boot**: Provides Inversion of Control (IoC) and Dependency Injection for building scalable applications.
- **Spring Data JPA**: Enables ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) and simplifies database interactions.
- **Spring Security**: Ensures secure API access using JWT-based authentication and password encoding with BCrypt.
- **PostgreSQL**: The relational database management system (RDBMS) used for storing database entities.
- **Redis**: Caches database queries to enhance performance and reduce load on PostgreSQL.
- **Docker**: Containerizes the application for easy deployment and scalability using Docker images and Docker Compose.  

## Next Steps

### **Performance Enhancements**
- Optimize database queries with indexing and caching.
- Implement pagination for API responses.

### **Feature Improvements**
- Add task dependencies (e.g., blocking tasks until prerequisites are completed).
- Add task and comment history.
